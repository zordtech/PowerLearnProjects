Project Overview

PhishGuard is an AI-driven cybersecurity solution designed to detect and prevent phishing attacks through intelligent email classification. Built using robust machine learning techniques and engineered with enterprise-grade scalability in mind, the system analyzes email content to determine whether a message is legitimate or malicious, helping users and organizations avoid social engineering attacks, credential theft, and financial loss.

The project follows a complete end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from dataset preparation and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model development, performance evaluation, and deployment using a Flask-based web interface that enables real-time email scanning. Models and feature vectorizers are preserved as pickle files to support seamless integration into existing security systems.

PhishGuard is part of Operation SafeZone, an advanced security-focused AI initiative targeting digital safety in high-risk communication environments. Although currently built with traditional machine learning methods, the system has been designed to evolve into more sophisticated architectures, including NLP-based deep learning models (e.g., BERT) and possible integration into enterprise email gateways or SIEM tools.

By blending data science precision with cybersecurity best practices, PhishGuard serves as both a defensive tool and an educational resource, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged to combat modern cyber threats.
